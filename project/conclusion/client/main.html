   <h3>Rate your experience with the framework/CMS you chose:</h3>
    <p>Overall experience with Meteor: 8/10</p>
   <h3>Did it perform to your expectations?</h3>
    <p>Meteor managed to perform towards most of our expectations. Creating a project was simple. Entering the <b>meteor</b> command in the command prompt granted all of the files needed for a Meteor 
       application to run (an HTML file, a JavaScript file, a CSS file, and additional files). This allowed us to have a steady platform to expand on given that Meteor had prepared a well planned 
       layout for its default applications. In turn, the framework was very responsive and managed to create real-time updated UI's with ease.</p>
   <h3>Was it difficult to install or configure?</h3>
    <p>This all depends on what operating system you are performing the installation on. If you are installing Meteor on OSX/Linux, you simply need to run the <b>curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh</b> command to install the latest official Meteor release. On Windows, its requires more than one step. You first need to install Chocolatey, which is a Package Manager like apt-get or yum but for Windows. Following the installation of Chocolatey, you then need to run the command prompt as an Administrator and run the following command to install Meteor: <b>choco install meteor</b>. After that, you wait until all the Meteor files have been extracted before you begin using it. Personally, installing Meteor on Windows took a couple of attempts due to having to input extra commands 
       in the command prompt in order to get the installer to run properly.</p>
   <h3>Was it easy to create the page with it?</h3>
    <p>Creating our webpage with the Meteor framework was just as simple as creating a basic webpage using HTML/CSS. The best part about this framework was its ability to display real-time changes 
       in a very responsive manner.</p>
   <h3>Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS?</h3>
    <p>As long as you have basic fundamental knowledge of HTML/CSS and Javascript, the frameworks components are easy to pick up and learn.</p>
   <h3>Would you have done things differently in retrospect?</h3>
    <p>Besides learning a bit more about MongoDB prior, given that Meteor only integrates the MongoDB database, we would not have done anything differently since Meteor helped expand our knowledge 
       on JavaScript framework overall.</p>
   <h3>Did you regret your choice of framework/CMS?</h3>
    <p>The only difficulty we had was hosting the site since there aren't many resources on how to host but once we discovered Heroku's web hosting service it made things much easier. Other than 
       that it was a pleasure learning about Meteor's overall capabilities and the experience gained in working through this framework felt very rewarding!</p>
